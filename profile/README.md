# Powering Climate Action Through Open Source Tech
Welcome to the Climate Intelligence Network! We are building open-source tech to drive climate action and accelerate a sustainable future.

### ðŸŽ® Featured Project: Mission 1.5Â°
> **Accurate, real-time data** is vital for understanding the complex environmental changes happening around us and for informing policy decisions. By engaging citizens in science and reporting, we harness local knowledge, create a sense of ownership, and fill critical data gaps that traditional methods often overlook.

Mission 1.5Â° empowers citizens and volunteers to actively participate in environmental conservation through engaging missions such as data collection, biodiversity monitoring, dereforestation monitoring, and invasive species tracking. By contributing vital environmental intelligence, users earn points and rewards, fostering a collective effort towards a healthier planet.
